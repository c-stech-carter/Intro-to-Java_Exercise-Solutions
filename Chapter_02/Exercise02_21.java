Solution for Exercise 2-21 From Intro to Java 13th Edition

2.21 (Financial application: calculate future investment value) Write a program that reads in
investment amount, annual interest rate, and number of years and displays the future
investment value using the following formula:

futureInvestmentValue =
investmentAmount Ã— (1 + monthlyInterestRate)^(numberOfYears*12)

For example, if you enter amount 1000, annual interest rate 3.25%, and number of years 1,
the future investment value is 1032.98.

Sample Run for Exercise02_21.java

Enter input data for the program (Sample data provided below. You may modify it.)
1000.56 4.25 1

Execution Result:
JDK18>java Exercise02_21
Enter the investment amount, for example 120000.95: 1000.56
Enter annual interest rate, for example 8.25: 4.25
Enter number of years as an integer, for example 5: 1
Future value is $1043.92
